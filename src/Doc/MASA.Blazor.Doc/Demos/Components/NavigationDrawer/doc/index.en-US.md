## Navigation drawers
The v-navigation-drawer component is what your users will utilize to navigate through the application. The navigation-drawer is pre-configured to work with or without vue-router right out the box. For the purpose of display, some examples are wrapped in a v-card element. Within your application you will generally place the v-navigation-drawer as a direct child of v-app.
