You can place your layout elements anywhere, as long as you apply the app property. The key component in all of this is m-main. This will be dynamically sized depending upon the structure of your designated app components. You can use combinations of any or all of the above components including m-bottom-navigation.

When using vue-router it is recommended that you place your views inside m-main.
